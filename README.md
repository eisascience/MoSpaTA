Mouse Spatial-omics Testis Atlas

## Introduction

This interactive atlas, is an amalgam of :

A) MoDSTA: The Mouse Developmental Testis Atlas, derived from public 10X data of multiple adult WT mice and several samples from available developmental stages. 

B) STseqMT1: Spatial OMIC data from a WT adult mouse using Stereo-seq technology, with their "celll" level data derived from segmentation of DAPI signal

C) SlideSeqMT1: This dataset represents a spatial transcriptomic atlas of a healthy adult wild-type (WT) mouse, from 'Dissecting mammalian spermatogenesis using spatial transcriptomics, DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109915' paper.


D) SDA results: SDA is a machine-learning "soft clustering" technique that is able to learn transcriptional patterns in high dimensional transcriptomic space. Several SDA models were trained on subsets of MoDSTA for specialized training.
